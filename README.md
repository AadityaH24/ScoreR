# ScoreR
An initial attempt at creating software that can idenitfy marks from an answer sheet and tally them. This project was created as part of the project component in our Foundation fo Artificial Intelligence (CSE1014) course. We used various concepts, including OpenCV image recognition, Hough Circle Transforms, and model training using the MNIST and our custom dataset made using https://github.com/JC-ProgJava/Handwritten-Digit-Dataset.
